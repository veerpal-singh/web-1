            <h1>Residential Pest Control Service In</h1>
            <p>Due to Melbourne’s cyclical climate, the city experiences a true “pest season” when the number of insects and spiders increases dramatically in the spring and summer. In addition to the common pests, Melbourne also possesses the hazardous European wasp. The city of Melbourne has a termite problem, but their activity levels drop slightly in the winter. During these colder months, which we call “rodent season,” rodents like rats and mice seek warmth and safety indoors.

                <h1>The Need For Pest Control:</h1>
                <p>Australia is one of those countries who are at the top of the list regarding pest infestations. In cities like Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne or Sydney pest infestation is common, especially in built-up premises. Pests thrive in the human environment and multiply fast. Pest treatment is advisable, before it is late.</p>
                <h6>Pest inspections and control treatments are mandatory after the end of a lease agreements. The bond of lease agreement cannot be renewed or got back, if the premises does not get certified after the inspection. Dwelling and working places get difficult, if infested with pests, rodents, bugs and other nasty critters</h6>
                <h5>Pests normally remain unseen, dwelling and multiplying in areas like floor gaps, beds, crevices in our walls and furniture, storage areas, gardens and lawns, trash cans etc. Insects like bugs, spiders, beetles are known irritants in any place. One of the most destructive creatures are rats, mice and rodents. They not only cause serious damage to our property, but also carry deadly diseases and viruses and parasites.</h5>
